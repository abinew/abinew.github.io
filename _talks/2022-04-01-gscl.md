[Abstract](https://www.gscl.org/en/2022/04/01/seidmuhieyimam.html)

The development of natural language processing and AI applications require a **gold standard** dataset. Data is the pillar of those intelligent applications, and an annotation is a way to acquire it. In this talk, I will first discuss the main **components of WebAnno**, one of the most popular annotation tools to date, which is a generic, distributive, and web-based annotation tool. I will then discuss the extension of WebAnno, which is called **CodeAnno**, that supports hierarchical document-level annotation, particularly for the codebook annotation in social science. In the second part of my talk, the **approaches and challenges of social NLP datasets**, such as hate speech, sentiment, and fake news datasets using crowdsourcing frameworks. I will conclude the talk by presenting our Telegram bot-based social media annotation tool called **ASAB**, which is built to alleviate crowdsourcing limitations in the annotation of low-resource languages.
